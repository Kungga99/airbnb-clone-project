# Airbnb Clone Project

## Project Overview
This is a full-stack clone of the popular accommodation booking platform Airbnb. The goal is to build a fully functional web application where users can search, view, and book properties.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React)
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub
- **Design Tools**: Figma for UI/UX design


## UI/UX Design Planning

### Design Goals

- Create an intuitive booking flow for users
- Maintain visual consistency across all pages
- Ensure fast loading times for performance
- Prioritize mobile responsiveness for all devices

### Key Features

- Property search with filters (location, price, dates, etc.)
- Detailed property view with images and description
- Secure and streamlined checkout process
- User authentication (sign up, login, logout)

### Primary Pages

| Page                  | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Property Listing View | Grid display of available properties with filtering options                |
| Listing Detailed View | Full property details with images, location, host info, and booking option |
| Simple Checkout View  | Streamlined payment form and booking confirmation                          |

### Importance of User-Friendly Design

A well-designed booking system helps users easily find and reserve properties. This reduces friction in the user journey, boosts conversion rates, and enhances overall satisfaction. Key elements like clear navigation, responsive layout, and consistent visual cues are essential for a great experience.


### Color Styles

- **Primary**: `#FF5A5F`
- **Secondary**: `#008489`
- **Background**: `#FFFFFF`
- **Text**: `#222222`
- **Secondary Text**: `#717171`

### Typography

- **Primary Font**: Circular
- **Headings**: Bold (700), 24pxâ€“32px
- **Body Text**: Medium (500), 16px
- **Secondary Text**: Book (400), 14px

### Importance of Identifying Design Properties

Understanding and extracting design properties from Figma is critical for achieving visual consistency across the application. These properties ensure that the frontend implementation matches the design system, improves collaboration between developers and designers, and allows for scalable and maintainable UI development.
